# syracuse
a site to check every number of the syracus conjecture

explaination :
let a number
if it is even, divide it per two
if it is odd, multiply it per three and add one
exemple : we take 5, his odd so we do 5*3+1 = 16, 16 is even, so 16/3= 8, 8 is even so 8/2 = 4, 4 is even so 4/2 = 2, 2 is even so 2/2=1, 1 is odd so 1*3+1=4,4/2=2,2/2=1


when you repeat this operation you will obligatory return to 1
to resolve this conjecture we need to obtain a different number at the end, or simply not have a solution

the higher we test is 2^68 made by David Ba≈ôina, ( not with my simply site xD )
